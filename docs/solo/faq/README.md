### What is the Website Monitoring tool intended for?

The Website Monitoring tool is intended for monitoring the domain main page generation time and errors occurring when requesting the main page (the main tab).

* The administrator can get the list of the slowest requests during 24 hours (the PHP Slow Site analyzer tab).
* The administrator can receive the daily reports with the list of the slow requests.
* The administrator receives instant emails if the domain main page is unavailable.

You can read more about the Website Monitoring tool [here](/solo/manager/#website-monitoring-tool).

### What is the X-Ray tool intended for?

The X-ray tool is intended for deep analysis of slow request cause. The X-ray tool can provide information about software modules and plugins execution time, database queries, system functions and external requests execution time.

It can be used by the administrator and by the user.

You can read more about the X-Ray tool [here](/solo/manager/#x-ray).

### Will the Website Monitoring Tool (WMT) work with the LiteSpeed and Nginx web servers?

### What is the process of upgrading if the customer adds more users to the server and will have to upgrade? (i.e., upgrading from CloudLinux OS Solo to CloudLinux OS Shared)

Create a new server by [converting an existing server](/solo/installation/#converting-existing-servers) or [from ISO](/solo/installation/#iso-file-source)) and migrate the settings of that one user.

### Where can I use the WP Optimization Suite?

In the current beta release only on CloudLinux OS Solo and cPanel. In the next releases it will be available for CloudLinux OS Shared PRO.

### How will it help my customers?

In the current beta version, the WP Optimization Suite automatically configures the Object Cache module per site. In the next releases we will add modules to help automatically increase performance for WordPress sites.

### How to set up PHP-fpm handler for the domain?

Since the PHP-fpm handler is required to use WP Optimization Suite, you may need to configure it manually.

These are configuration steps:

1. Ensure the PHP-fpm package for the current PHP version is installed or install it.

    * **Manual installation**
    
    Run the following command:
    ```
    yum -y install ea-phpXY-php-fpm
    ```
    Where `XY` - is required PHP version, for instance `ea-php74-php-fpm`

    * **Via MultiPHP Manager**
