### How to set up PHP-fpm handler for the domain?

Since the PHP-fpm handler is required to use AccelerateWP, you may need to configure it manually.

These are configuration steps:

1. Ensure the PHP-fpm package for the current PHP version is installed or install it.

    * **Manual installation**
    
    Run the following command:
    ```
    yum -y install ea-phpXY-php-fpm
    ```
    Where `XY` - is required PHP version, for instance `ea-php74-php-fpm`

    * **Via MultiPHP Manager**
